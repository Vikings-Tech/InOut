# Gamer's Galaxy
A safe space gaming platform where you can connect with you friends and find strangers whom you vibe with, play games and have some good time

## Problem Statement
Current state of the world has brought to attention the intolerance towards diversity and general negativity that is out there, regular social medias have become a place of negativity and political agendas. People need to connect to others and therefore the need of social medias but conventional social medias are too open, anyone can try to connect with you or look up your profile which is a matter of great concern.  
## Our Solution
Our platform is a gaming platform where you can connect with your friends directly or with strangers through a swipe based mechanism , the process is simple 
1. You look at their card and read their bio.
2. If you feel that you vibes match, you right swipe
3. If you don't want to connect to the other person you left swipe
4. If both of you swipe each other you connect!

On connecting with the other person you can chat with them or challenge them to a casual game or you can find some mutual interest and talk about it. This platform is a safe space in the sense that you only connect to people you want. We believe that games have the power to connect people and bring some fun and positivity. Therefore our platform encourages users to connect and play regular as well as Augmented Reality multiplayer games on this platform with your friends.
