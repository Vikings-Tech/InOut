# Gamer's Galaxy
A safe space gaming platform where you can connect with you friends and find strangers whom you vibe with, play games and have some good time

## Problem Statement
- There is a lack of Indian gaming platforms
- Gaming platforms do not include XR games
- Regular gaming platforms make you a “couch-gamer”
- Social Apps like dating platforms can make the ice-breaking stage really awkward
- Regular social media platforms allow anyone to find and contact you, risking your privacy.

## Our Solution
We bring you a platform where you can connect with your friends and meet new people who share similar interests. Once you connect, our app allows you to casually chat with your friend or indulge in some casual gaming. Our games have conventional as well as AR mode which gives you a more immersive gaming experience. AR games also encourage you to move around while playing therefore a more healthy gaming experience.

## Features

- Connect to your friends
  - Add your friends to the app by sharing your unique ID and sending a friend request
- Finding new people made easier
  - Swipe people who have similar interests and connect with them 
  - You both mutually decide if you want to connect therefore a level of trust is established
  - Your profile be targeted in any way therefore lesser cases of harassments
- No more awkward ice-breakers
  - After you connect you can directly challenge them to a multiplayer casual game
- Free to play multiplayer gaming platform 
  - Recent gaming platforms have been betting focused where you need to pay to play whereas our app would be entirely free to play
  - True multiplayer games let you compete against your friends 
- Augmented Reality mode of our games provide for an immersive experience
  - This genre hasn’t been discovered much
  - Healthier to move around and play rather than just sit and play
## Tech used:
-Unity
  - Our Application has been completely built on Unity Engine
  - For our UX we have focused on scripting the animations instead of using animator for a more optimized experience
  - UI has been built on Photoshop and moved onto Unity
- Firebase
  - We have used firebase authentication and database for our prototype
  - Firebase realtime database has been used to create near real time features including swipe, friend requests, challenges and chat
- Photon
  - Photon is used for the multiplayer games in our application.
  - Photon Unity Networking with Photon Realtime helps to create a room with two people easily and create data that should exist in the room and share score and player boards.
  
## Future Prospects
- AR voice puppets 
  - Send audio notes and choose an avatar to deliver it 
  - Other person receives that note through the avatar in AR
- Cloud anchor based games
  - Real location multiplayer games for when you meet your friends in real world
- NLP based profile matching
  - We plan to use NLP to categorise user Bio and then prioritise matching them
  - This would also flag any troll profiles before it reaches our users
- AR Advertisement
  - Advertisement based AR games that promote brand content

## Cost of Implementation
- To implement this plan we require Rs.20000 in total for servers (Photon + Azure Playfabs + AWS Cloud) considering a crowd of 5000 players for the first 12 months.
- For hiring work we will require Rs.20000 per month
  - This includes Graphic designers to make the Game assets
  - Backend engineers to make a scalable backend to upload games, user data etc.
- So considering that our app kicks in at 12 months in total costs = 20000 + 12 * 20000 = Rs. 2,60,000

## Why support us?

We are building one of a kind AR gaming platform. Gaming platforms are better than individual games :-
1. You have more variety in a single app
2. Let us worry about getting you the new trendy games
3. A fun way to connect to your friends

Indian games have recently been a rising industry and with the ban of Chinese applications there has been a void. With the pandemic still going on our application can help connect people and take some edge off. This is the absolute right time to launch an application like this when people are isolated and can’t connect to others.

Most of all, by supporting us you will be supporting Indian XR gaming industry which hasn’t been explored much and this would be a step in the direction of Atma Nirbhar Bharat
